# Production Issues Fix Guide

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. No Products Showing in Production

**Problem**: The database in production doesn't have any products seeded.

**Solution**:

- Added production seeding script (`scripts/seed-production.ts`)
- Created API endpoint for manual seeding (`/api/seed`)
- Added npm script `db:seed:prod`

### 2. Cannot Add Categories

**Problem**: The categories API only had GET endpoint, no POST to create categories.

**Solution**:

- Added POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints to `/api/categories`
- Created `AdminCategoryManager` component
- Added category management tab to admin panel

## How to Fix Production Issues

### Option 1: Manual Seeding via API (Recommended)

1. Deploy the updated code to Vercel
2. Visit your production URL and call the seeding endpoint:
   ```
   POST https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/seed
   ```
3. This will create 4 categories and 8 sample products

### Option 2: Using Vercel CLI

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run the seeding script locally with production database:
   ```bash
   npm run db:seed:prod
   ```

### Option 3: Database Management

1. Access your PostgreSQL database directly
2. Run the seeding script manually
3. Or use a database management tool to insert sample data

## New Features Added

### Category Management

- **Admin Panel**: New "Manage Categories" tab
- **Create Categories**: Add new categories with name and description
- **Edit Categories**: Modify existing categories
- **Delete Categories**: Remove categories (cascades to products)

### Enhanced Product Management

- **Better UI**: Improved product management interface
- **Category Selection**: Products now properly link to categories
- **Image URLs**: Added sample product images from Unsplash

## Database Schema

The database includes:

- **Categories**: Electronics, Clothing, Books, Home & Garden
- **Products**: 8 sample products across all categories
- **Images**: High-quality product images from Unsplash

## Testing the Fix

1. After seeding, visit your production site
2. Check the homepage for featured products
3. Visit `/products` to see all products
4. Test category filtering
5. Login as admin and test category/product management

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Vercel:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: For authentication
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Your production URL

## Troubleshooting

If products still don't show:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify database connection
3. Check if seeding was successful
4. Ensure all environment variables are set

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated code
2. Run the seeding process
3. Test the application
4. Add more products through the admin panel
5. Customize categories as needed
